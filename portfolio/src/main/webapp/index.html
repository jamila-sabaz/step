                In February 2019 my mum and I went to travel to USA. We did a road trip from Los Angeles to San 	useums 		and Silicon Valley campuses. 
                Then we realised a tour can be arranged only by a company representative, who we did not know, so we just stared at it from the outside (lol). This is me on Google HQ Mountain View campus, I came there as a tourist and I told my mum I wanted to work there, she was skeptical. 
                Itâ€™s been almost 2 years since then and now Iâ€™m a STEP intern at Google Sydney branch. Dreams come true!

                I've been playing chess since primary school, and liked to compete. In my country chess is considered as a serious sport and I played my way up to the title of Candidate Master of Sports in Chess. Currently I don't practice, I only played a few South Australian championates and Australian Young Masters Open Tournament (got destroyed in both). My FIDE rating dropped to whooping 1588.

                I love tech because it helps everyone and makes the world a better place every day. 
                I believe that tech is a tool, that makes things more accessible and easier for the user. It also is the most fast-moving and progressive industry, that is influencing everyoneâ€™s lives! So it has to be adaptive and tolerant in terms of social norms, diversity and inclusion ðŸ”­ðŸš€

The goal was to build a functional robot based on ardruino controllers executing a certain task - collecting, transporting and releasing a payload of 20 plastic balls from one container to another.
