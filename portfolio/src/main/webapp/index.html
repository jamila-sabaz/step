                I joined EY in February 2022 as a grad consultant as I streamlined my passion to software engineering into tech consulting. My first engagement was a long-term program at insurance provider where I upskilled my scrum and agile methodologies knowledge and contributed to Technology operational model and IT Risk Assessment controls.
                <br>
                Outside of my engagement I am involved in internal EY initiatives such as EY DNA Solutions Hub as a Junior Cloud Engineer. I am practicing creating Azure infrastructures using ARM templates as well as contributing to the Data Product Framework with pipelines customization and deployment.

                I love aerial gymnastics. I started doing it around 4 years ago and progressed a lot since then. I primarily train on aerial silks, aerial hoop and trapeze. It is my passion outside of work and I enjoy it, I learnt to enjoy training my core strength and almost got a <b>visible</b> six pack.

                I love tech because of its' potential to help and makes the world a better place every day. 
                I believe that technologies is a tool, that makes things more accessible and easier for the users. It also is the most fast-moving and progressive industry, that is influencing everyone's lives! So it has to be adaptive for diversity and inclusion.
                <br><br>
                As an EY consultant I aspire to be a subject matter expert in the field of cloud computing and engineering. And build a better working world.
